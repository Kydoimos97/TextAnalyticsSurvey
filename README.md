# TextAnalyticsSurvey
A survey of six different text classification models.

The purpose of this project is to take a deep dive into text classification with a focus on comparing classification algorithms, trough performance metrics, and outcomes. 
Text classification is a form of predictive and descriptive analytics that allows for a wide variety of applications. Examples of classification applications are News filtering, Document Organization, Opinion Mining, and spam filtering (Aggarwal & ChengXiang, 2012)

This project focusses on review classification and will be employed to gain a deeper understanding of different algorithms. The potential focus originates from the datasets that have been found that fit the goal of the project. Within the project, the preference is to take the focus off of data cleaning and focus on algorithm comparison.

The Code is written in R with the initial file being "Final Project TA.rmd". 

If code is extracted/copied please reference this repository.
